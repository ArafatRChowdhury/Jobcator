## User Interface design
### Desktop View

This is how the app would look on a desktop device, such as a PC or laptop. The home page contains links to the log in and sign up pages. Once logged in, the user is automatically redirected to the respective profile pages of whatever type of user they have logged in as.

### Mobile View

This is how the app would look on a mobile device. It works the exact same as the desktop version.
